# Post-Incident Analysis
Post-Incident Analysis is a component of the SRE Incident Management Automation project that is responsible for analyzing incidents after they have been resolved to identify root causes and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

## Usage

To use this component, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided.

You can run the `analysis.py script` manually using the command `python analysis.py`. Alternatively, you can trigger the script automatically when an incident is resolved by integrating it into your incident management system

## Configuration

The behavior of Post-Incident Analysis can be customized by modifying the `analysis.yaml` configuration file. This file specifies the analysis tasks to perform and the output format for the analysis report.
