# SRE-Incident-management-automation

This project aims to automate the incident management process for SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) teams. SRE teams are responsible for ensuring the reliability, availability, and performance of software systems. When an incident occurs, SREs need to identify the root cause, mitigate the impact, and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. However, this process can be time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing with large-scale or distributed systems.

The SRE-Incident-Management-Automation project provides a set of tools and processes to automate the incident management workflow. The key features of this project include:

Automated incident detection: The system uses various monitoring tools and techniques to detect incidents as soon as they occur. This allows SREs to start working on the issue right away, reducing the mean time to detect (MTTD).
